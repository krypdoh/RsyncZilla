# RsyncZilla Release Notes

## Version 1.2.2 (2026-09-16)

### ✨ New Features & Improvements
- **Configurable Transfer Overwrite Action (FileZilla Style)**:
  - Added new **`Transfer`** menu with a configurable *Overwrite Action* selector.
  - Supports 4 sync modes:
    1. **Overwrite if size or date differ**: Standard `rsync -avzP` without `--update`. Updates the destination file whenever its size or modification timestamp differs from the source, resolving issues where files with newer destination timestamps were silently skipped.
    2. **Overwrite only if source is newer (`--update`)**: Preserves newer remote modifications when desired.
    3. **Overwrite always (`--ignore-times`)**: Forces rsync delta-block calculation on every selected file.
    4. **Compare by content checksum (`--checksum`)**: Validates differences by file contents instead of modification times.
- **Fixed Menu Drop Alignment on Touch / Tablet PCs**:
  - Ensures menu popups always open left-aligned on all computers, bypassing Windows Tablet PC handedness settings.
- **Persistent User Settings**:
  - Automatically remembers the selected overwrite action across sessions (`%AppData%\RsyncZilla\settings.json`).
